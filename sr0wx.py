# This is main program file for automatic weather station project;
# codename SR0WX.
#
# (At the moment) SR0WX can read METAR [#]_ weather informations and
# is able to read them aloud in Polish. SR0WX is fully extensible, so
# it's easy to make it read any other data in any language (I hope).

#
# =====
# About
# =====
#
# Every automatic station's callsign in Poland (SP) is prefixed by "SR".
# This software is intended to read aloud weather informations (mainly).
# That's why we (or I) called it SR0WX.
#
# Extensions (mentioned above) are called ``modules`` (or ``languages``).
# Main part of SR0WX is called ``core``.
#
# SR0WX consists quite a lot of independent files so I (SQ6JNX) suggest
# reading other manuals (mainly configuration- and internationalization
# manual) in the same time as reading this one. Really.
#
# ============
# Requirements
# ============
#
# SR0WX (core) requires the following packages:

import os,sys
import pygame
import time
import config
import lib.cw as cw
import debug, traceback

# ``os``, ``sys`` and ``time`` doesn't need further explanation, these are
# syandard Python packages.
#
# ``pygame`` [#]_ is a library helpful for game development, this project
# uses it for reading (playing) sound samples. ``config`` is just a
# SR0WX configuration file and it is described seperately.
#
# ..[#] www.pygame.org
#
# =========
# Let's go!
# =========
#
# For infrmational purposes script says hello and gives local time/date,
# so it will be possible to find out how long script was running.

debug.log("CORE", "sr0wx.py started")

# All datas returned by SR0WX modules will be stored in ``data`` variable.

data = " "

# Information about which modules are to be executed is written in SR0WX
# config file. Programm starts every single of them and appends it's return
# value in ``data`` variable. As you can see every module is started with
# language variable, which is also defined in configuration.
# Refer configuration and internationalization manuals for further
# informations.
#
# Modules may be also given in commandline, separated by a comma.
